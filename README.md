# React Interactive Interview

We'll be adding a feature to an React implementation of the classic [ToDoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).

Although this interview is technical in nature (requiring JavaScript expertise, commandline familiarity, code reading, and debugging), it is more importantly a chance to see how you think and work with others.

## Preparation

1. Ensure you have node installed on your development machine
2. Clone this repo and run the following in the root of the project
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`
5. You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:1234

This project is built in React 16.7.x with React 16.7.x dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

**If `npm start` doesn't work**
Try installing Parcel globally with `npm install -g parcel-bundler`
